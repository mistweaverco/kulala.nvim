# Using Variables

You can use variables in your HTTP requests.

## Basic document variables

Create a file with the `.http` extension and write your HTTP requests in it.

```http title="examples.http"
@pokemon=pikachu
@pokemon2=bulbasaur

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{{pokemon}} HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json

###

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{{pokemon2}} HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

These variables are available in all requests in the file.

## Prompt variables

You can also use prompt variables. These are variables that you can set when you run the request.

```http title="examples.http"
# @prompt pokemon
GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{{pokemon}} HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

When you run this request, you will be prompted to enter a value for `pokemon`.

These variables are available for the current request and all subsequent requests in the file.
