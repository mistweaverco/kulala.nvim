# Optional Requirements

To make things a lot easier,
you can put this lua snippet somewhere in your configuration:

```lua
vim.filetype.add({
  extension = {
    ['http'] = 'http',
  },
})
```

This will make Neovim recognize files with the `.http` extension as HTTP files.

[ts]: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter

Kulala.nvim comes with a parser compiled with the latest version of treesitter. 

If you have Neovim `0.10.x`, you might get an error `ABI version mismatch for kulala_http.so: supported between 13 and 14, found 15`.

You need to install `tree-sitter CLI` and recompile the parser:

1. Delete the existing parser at `nvim-treesitter/parser/kulala_http`
2. Install the `tree-sitter CLI` (if not installed already):
    - from distribution repositories
    - or from https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/crates/cli
3. Recompile the parser:
    - Open a  `http` file in Neovim (this will load Kulala)
    - Run `:TSInstallFromGrammar kulala_http`
