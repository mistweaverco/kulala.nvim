## Install

> [!WARNING]
> Requires Neovim 0.10.0+ and cURL.
>
> See [requirements](https://neovim.getkulala.net/docs/getting-started/requirements).

Via [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

### Configuration

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
  {
    "mistweaverco/kulala.nvim",
    keys = {
      { "<leader>Rs", desc = "Send request" },
      { "<leader>Ra", desc = "Send all requests" },
      { "<leader>Rb", desc = "Open scratchpad" },
    },
    ft = {"http", "rest"},
    opts = {
      -- your configuration comes here
      global_keymaps = false,
      global_keymaps_prefix = "<leader>R",
      kulala_keymaps_prefix = "",
    },
  },
})
```

> [!WARNING]
>`opts` needs to be at least an empty table `{}` and can't be completely omitted.

> [!NOTE]
> By default global keymaps are disabled, change to `global_keymaps = true` to get a complete set of key mappings for Kulala. Check the [keymaps documentation](https://neovim.getkulala.net/docs/getting-started/keymaps) for details.

See complete [configuration options](https://neovim.getkulala.net/docs/getting-started/configuration-options) for more information.

## Honorable mentions

### rest.nvim

For getting this project started.

This project was heavily inspired by the idea of having a REST client in Neovim.

The actual state of [rest.nvim](https://github.com/rest-nvim/rest.nvim)
as archived kicked off the development of kulala.nvim.

> [!NOTE]
> The project has been [un-archived][restnvim-unarchived-post] again,
> so check it out if you're looking for an alternative.

### curl.nvim

If you want a simple scratchpad for making HTTP requests,
check out [curl.nvim](https://github.com/oysandvik94/curl.nvim)

It's very different to this project, but it's a great tool for making
HTTP requests from within Neovim and maybe just your cup of tea.

### httpbin.org

For providing a great service for testing HTTP requests and
making it in all the kulala examples.

Thanks for making it easy to test and develop this plugin.
