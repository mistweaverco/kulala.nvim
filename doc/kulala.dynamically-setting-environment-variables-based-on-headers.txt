1. Dynamically setting environment variables based on headers*kulala.dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-headers-dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-headers*

You can set environment variables based on the headers of a HTTP request.

Create a file with the `.http` extension and write your HTTP requests in it.


EXAMPLE*kulala.dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-headers-dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-headers-example*

The headers of the first request can be obtained and used in the second
request.

In this example, the `Content-Type` and `Date` headers are received in the
first request.

```http title="simple.http" # @name REQUEST_ONE POST https://httpbin.org/post
HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json Accept: application/json

{ "type": "very-simple" }


 ~

POST https://httpbin.org/post HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json Accept:
application/json

{ "success": true, "previous_request_header_content_type":
"{{REQUEST_ONE.response.headers['Content-Type']}}",
"previous_request_header_date": "{{REQUEST_ONE.response.headers.Date}}" } ```
