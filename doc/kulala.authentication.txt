How to handle authentication in Kulala.

In general, you can use the `Authorization` header to send an authentication
token to the server. The content of the header depends on the type of
authentication you are using.

See these topics for more information:

SUPPORTED AUTHENTICATION TYPES*kulala.authentication-authentication-supported-authentication-types*

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Signature version 4 is a protocol for authenticating
requests to AWS services.

New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM), is a suite of Microsoft security protocols
that provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to users.

Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, Bearer Token, OAuth 2.0, AWS Signature V4 and
SSL Client Certificates are supported.


BASIC AUTHENTICATION*kulala.authentication-authentication-basic-authentication*

Basic authentication needs a Base64 encoded string of `username:password` as
the value of the `Authorization` header.

If given it’ll be directly used in the HTTP request:

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic TXlVc2VyOlByaXZhdGU=
<

Furthermore you can enter username and password in plain text in the
`Authorization` header field, separated by a colon; Kulala will automatically
encode it for you.

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic {{Username}}:{{Password}}
<


DIGEST AUTHENTICATION*kulala.authentication-authentication-digest-authentication*

Digest is implemented the same way as Basic authentication.

You can enter the `username:password` in plain text

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Digest {{Username}}:{{Password}}
<

or `username password`

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Digest {{Username}} {{Password}}
<


WEB-BROWSER BASED AUTHENTICATION*kulala.authentication-authentication-web-browser-based-authentication*

Below is an example of how to simulate a web-browser based authentication with
CSRF protection:

>http
    ### Acquire_XSRF_TOKEN
    
    GET localhost:8000/login
    
    > {%
      -- lua
      client.global.token = response.cookies["XSRF-TOKEN"].value
      client.global.decoded_token = vim.uri_decode(client.global.token)
      client.global.session = response.cookies["laravel_session"].value
    %}
    
    ### Authentication
    
    POST localhost:8000/login
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Xsrf-Token: {{decoded_token}}
    Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN={{token}}
    Cookie: laravel_session={{session}}
    Referer: http://localhost:8000/login
    
    {
      "email": "mail@mail.com",
      "password": "passpass"
    }
    
    > {%
      -- lua
      -- save the new set authenticated session
      client.global.session = response.cookies["laravel_session"].value
    %}
    
    ### Dashboard
    
    run #Acquire_XSRF_TOKEN
    run #Authentication
    
    GET http://localhost:8000/dashboard
    Cookie: laravel_session={{session}}
<


NTLM AUTHENTICATION *kulala.authentication-authentication-ntlm-authentication*

For NTLM authentication, you need to provide the username and password the same
way:

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: NTLM {{Username}}:{{Password}}
<

or

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: NTLM {{Username}} {{Password}}
<

or without any username where the current user is been used

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: NTLM
<


NEGOTIATE                     *kulala.authentication-authentication-negotiate*

This is a SPNEGO-based implementation, which doesn’t need username and
password, but uses the default credentials.

>http
    GET https://www/api HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Negotiate
<


BEARER TOKEN               *kulala.authentication-authentication-bearer-token*

For a Bearer Token you need to send your credentials to an authentication
endpoint and receive a token in return.

This token is then used in the `Authorization` header for further requests.


SENDING THE CREDENTIALS

>http
    ### login
    POST {{loginURL}} HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Accept: application/json
    
    client_id={{ClientId}}&client_secret={{ClientSecret}}&grant_type=client_credentials&scope={{Scope}}
<

This is a `login` named request with the credentials and the result may look
like

>json
    {
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3599,
      "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni....."
    }
<

With the request variables feature from Kulala you can now access the
`access_token` and use it in the next requests.

>http
    GET {{apiURL}}/items HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer {{login.response.body.$.access_token}}
<


OAUTH 2.0 AUTHORIZATION*kulala.authentication-authentication-oauth-2.0-authorization*

Kulala supports OAuth 2.0 authorization for Grant Types: `Authorization Code`,
`Client Credentials`, `Device Authorization`, `Implicit and Password`.

You can get/refresh an access token and authenticate your request to OAuth 2.0
protected resources. To let you enter the user credentials, Kulala will launch
your default browser and will intercept access tokens automatically if the
redirect URL is set to localhost.

A typical flow includes the following steps:

1. Specify authentication settings, such as the grant type and token URL, in JSON
format in a public environment file `http-client.env.json`.


2. Refer to this authentication configuration in your HTTP requests using the
`$auth.token` variable.


3. Run the request. If authentication is successful, you will access the protected
resource. You can check the received access token, refresh token and other
authentication details in the `auth_data` section of
`http-client.prrivate.env.json` file.


4. You can also manually revoke and refresh the access token or re-initialize the
authentication procedure by requesting a new token.




CREATE AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION

You can manually create an authentication configuration in the
`http-client.env.json` file or use Kulala Authentication Manager to create it
for you.

1. Press `<leader>Ru` to open the Authentication Manager, then press `a` to add a new authentication configuration.

This will create a configuration template for the authentication configuration
in the `http-client.env.json` file, under the current environment.

If you need to change the environment, use `<leader>Re` to open the Environment
Manager and select the environment you want to use. The environment file will
be searched for upwards from the folder of the current buffer. If no
environment file is found, it will be created in the current folder.

>json
    {
      "dev": {
          "Security": {
            "Auth": {
              "auth-id": {
                "Type": "OAuth2",
                "Grant Type": "",
                "Client ID": ""
                  ...
              }
            }
          }
        }
    }
<

Replace the placeholder `auth-id` with a meaningful name that you will use to
refer to this configuration in your .http file.

Specify the authentication parameters. The required parameters depend on the
selected "Grant Type". Remove unnecessary parameters from the template.

1. To edit `http-client.env.json` file, press `e` in the Authentication Manager. Press `p` for `http-client.private.env.json` file and press `m` to remove the authentication configuration.

It is recommended to store public authentication variables in the
`http-client.env.json` file and private authentication variables, like `Client
Secret`, in the `http-client.private.env.json` file. Auth configurations from
both files get merged during authentications.

Kulala will also use `http-client.private.env.json` file to store
authentication data, such as access token, refresh token, and expiration time.


USE AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION IN HTTP REQUESTS

Once an authentication configuration is created, you can use it to get an
access token and authenticate your requests.

Pass the name of an authentication configuration to the `{{$auth.token()}}`
variable, for example, `{{$auth.token("my-config")}}`. You can use this
variable in the request Authorization header or in query parameters.

>http
    POST {{loginURL}} HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Authorization: Bearer {{$auth.token("auth-id")}}
    Accept: application/json
<

Execute the request. Before accessing the protected resource, Kulala will open
your default browser (or whatever is specified in `Browser CMD`) and send a
request to the authorization server to obtain an access token.

When prompted, complete the authentication process. The browser will be
redirected to the provided `Redirect URL`.

If the provided `Redirect URL` is `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` or `Browser CMD` is
specified, Kulala will start a HTTP server on `localhost`, listening on port
specified in `Redirect URL` (or `8080`).

The HTTP server will then intercept this redirect and extract the authorization
details from the URL.

Otherwise, you need to copy the code from the redirect URL and paste it into
Kulala prompt manually.

For Grant Type `Device Authorization`, the code will be copied into clipboard,
to be pasted into consent form.

If the authentication is successfully completed, Kulala will access the
protected resource and the authentication details, such as access token,
refresh token, and expiration time, will be saved in the
`http-client.private.env.json` file.


MANUALLY ACQUIRE ACCESS TOKEN

When you refer to an authentication configuration in an HTTP request, Kulala
automatically gets (or refreshes) an access token before accessing the
protected resource. If you want to get an access token without sending an
actual request to the protected resource, you can acquire the access token
manually.

Open then Authentication Manager by pressing `<leader>Ru` and select the
authentication configuration you want to use, then press `g` to acquire a new
token or `r` to refresh the existing one.


REVOKE AN ACCESS TOKEN

You can revoke an access token by pressing `r` in the Authentication Manager.
This will revoke the access token with the provider and remove authentication
data from the `http-client.private.env.json` file.


USE ID TOKEN INSTEAD OF ACCESS TOKEN

If your server requires the use of an ID token instead of an access token, you
can configure Kulala to do this in any of the following ways:

In your authentication configuration, use the `"Use ID Token": true` parameter.

In an .http file, use the `$auth.idToken` variable, for example,
`Authorization: Bearer {{$auth.idToken("auth-id-1")}}`.


USE CUSTOM AUTHENTICATION PARAMETERS

Kulala provides an option to define custom request headers and parameters that
your authorization server may require. This includes, for example, resource and
audience that extend the OAuth 2.0 Authorization framework.

In your authentication configuration, you can add `Custom Headers` and `"Custom
Request Parameters"` object.

`Custom Headers` - is a simple header name - header value object.

Inside `"Custom Request Parameters"`, enter your parameter name and value (a
string or an array).

If you want to restrict the parameter usage to certain requests, define the
value as an object with two keys:

"Value" (parameter value)

"Use" — The scope for using the parameter. It has three possible values:

- "Use": "Everywhere" (in any request)
- "Use": "In Auth Request" (use in authentication requests only)
- "Use": "In Token Request" (use in token requests only)

For example:

>json
    "auth-id-1": {
    "Type": "OAuth2",
      "Custom Request Parameters": {
        "audience": {
          "Value": "https://my-audience.com/",
          "Use": "In Token Request"
        },
        "resource": [
          "https://my-resource/resourceId1",
          "https://my-resource/resourceId2"
        ],
        "my-custom-parameter": "my-custom-value"
      },
    }
<

If you need to set custom curl flags for authentication requests, e.g.,
`--insecure` to skip secure connection verification - you can do this with `#
@curl-..` flags in your .http file `Shared` block or by setting
`additional_curl_options` in Kulala’s config.


AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS


TYPE

Authentication type. Possible values:

"OAuth2": authenticate your request using OAuth2.


GRANT TYPE

Method to get access tokens. Possible values: "Authorization Code", "Client
Credentials", "Device Authorization", "Implicit", and "Password".


AUTH URL

Authorization URL to which the application will redirect the client request to
get the auth code.

"Auth URL" is required for Authorization Code and Implicit grant types.


TOKEN URL

The provider’s authentication server, to exchange an authorization code for
an access token.

"Token URL" is required for Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Device
Authorization, and Password grant types.


REDIRECT URL

Client application callback URL to which the request should be redirected after
authentication.

This can be a URL from your client application settings, or, if the
authorization server accepts any URL, use http://localhost:1234.


REVOKE URL

The URL to revoke the access token. This is optional and can be used to revoke
the access token with the provider.


CLIENT ID

Public identifier of your client registered with the API provider. The
parameter is required for all grant types.


CLIENT SECRET

Confidential identifier used by a client application to authenticate to an
authorization server.

The parameter is required for the Client Credentials grant type.


DEVICE AUTH URL

The URL to which the client device makes a request in order to obtain the
device code and user code.

Applicable and required for the Device Authorization grant type.


RESPONSE TYPE

The type of response to be returned by the authorization server. This value is
optional and will be added to the request URL automatically - `code` for
Authorization Code and `token` for Implicit grant types.

However, you can specify it manually if you need to use a different value or
several, like `id_token token`.


CLIENT CREDENTIALS

Enter one of the following:

- "none" if you do not want to specify client credentials in the request.
- "in body" if you want to send client credentials in the request body.
- "basic" to send a Basic authentication request in the request header (default
    value).
- "jwt" to send a JWT token in the request body.


PKCE

Enables Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). Applicable with the Authorization
Code grant type.

Enter "PKCE": true to use the default algorithm (S256 hashing the auto
generated code verifier). Or customize the behavior using "Code Challenge
Method" (plain or S256) and "Code Verifier". For example:

>json
    "PKCE": {
        "Code Challenge Method": "Plain",
        "Code Verifier": "YYLzIBzrXpVaH5KRx86itubKLXHNGnJBPAogEwkhveM"
    },
<


ASSERTION

For Grant Type `Client Credentials` with JWT token to authenticate the request.
You can provide the JWT token in this field.


JWT

If you would like for JWT token to be generated automatically, you can provide
the details in the `JWT` object.

For algorithm, `RS256` you also need to provide `private_key` in the
`http-client.private.env.json` file, for `HS256` the `Client Secret` is used.

Fields `exp` and `iat` are optional. If not provided, they will be calculated
automatically (iat = current time, exp = iat + 50 seconds).

>json
    "JWT": {
        "Header": {
          "alg": "RS256", -- or "HS256"
          "typ": "JWT"
        },
        "Payload": {
          "exp": 3600
          "iat": 17540,
        }
    }
<

If you would like to build a JWT token manually or generate PKCE
challenge/verifier , you can use built-in library in Lua request scripts:

>lua
    local crypto = require("kulala.cmd.crypto")
    
    ---@class JWTPayload
    ---@field iss? string Issuer
    ---@field sub? string Subject
    ---@field scope? string Scope
    ---@field aud? string Audience
    ---@field exp? number Expiration time (in seconds since epoch)
    ---@field iat? number Issued at (in seconds since epoch)
    
    ---Generate a JWT token
    ---@param header {alg: string, typ: string} JWT header alg: "RS256"|"HS256", typ: "JWT"
    ---@param payload JWTPayload JWT payload
    ---@param key string Signing key
    ---@return string|nil JWT token
    M.jwt_encode = function(header, payload, key)
    
    ---Generate a random PKCE verifier
    ---@return string|nil PKCE verifier
    M.pkce_verifier = function()
    
    
    ---Generate a PKCE challenge from the verifier
    ---@param verifier string PKCE verifier
    ---@param method string PKCE method "Plain"|"S256" (default: "S256")
    ---@return string|nil PKCE challenge
    M.pkce_challenge = function(verifier, method)
<


SCOPE

A scope to limit an application’s access to a user’s account. Possible
values depend on the service you are trying to access.


EXPIRES IN

If your auth provider does not return the `expires_in` field, a default value
of `10` seconds will be set. Otherwise, you can specify it manually in seconds.


ACQUIRE AUTOMATICALLY

By default, Kulala refreshes or acquires an access token automatically before
sending the request.

Enter `"Acquire Automatically": false` if you do not want to automatically
refresh or acquire an access token before sending the request. You can refresh
or acquire manually.


USERNAME

The username sent as part of authorization, used with the Password grant type.


PASSWORD

The user’s password sent as part of authorization, used with the Password
grant type.


CUSTOM REQUEST HEADERS

Specify custom request headers


CUSTOM REQUEST PARAMETERS

Specify custom request parameters


BROWSER CMD

Specify a shell command to open a browser/app to intercept `Redirect URL`.
Accepts `Auth URL` and `Redirect URL` as postional arguments. By default opens
the system default browser.


EXAMPLE:

In `lua/kulala/browser` you will find a working example of a custom
Electron-based browser, that will open `Auth URL`, intercept `Redirect URL`
(which does not have to point to localhost) and redirect the callback request
to Kulala local HTTP server. To install Electron - `npm install -g electron`.

Add to your Authentication configuration:

>json
    {
     "Browser CMD": "browser.js http://localhost:8080/callback" (optional),
    }
<

The browser script takes 2 arguments: the first is the `Auth URL` (passed by
Kulala) and the second is the `Redirect URL` to which the intercepted request
will be redirected. Both arguments are passed by Kulala, but if your `Redirect
URL` does not point to localhost or does not have a port number, you have to
specify `http://localhost:8080` manually as second argument in `Browser CMD`.


AWS SIGNATURE V4       *kulala.authentication-authentication-aws-signature-v4*

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Signature version 4 is a protocol for authenticating
requests to AWS services.

AWS Signature version 4 authenticates requests to AWS services. To use it you
need to set the Authorization header schema to AWS and provide your AWS
credentials separated by spaces:

>plaintext
    <access-key-id>: AWS Access Key Id
    <secret-access-key>: AWS Secret Access Key
    token:<aws-session-token>: AWS Session Token - required only for temporary credentials
    region:<region>: AWS Region
    service:<service>: AWS Service
<

>http
    GET {{apiUrl}}/ HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: AWS <access-key-id> <secret-access-key> token:<aws-session-token> region:<region> service:<service>
<


SSL CLIENT CERTIFICATE*kulala.authentication-authentication-ssl-client-certificate*

This is described in the configuration section and is done on a per-host basis.

Example:

>lua
    {
    "mistweaverco/kulala.nvim",
      opts = {
        certificates = {
          ["localhost"] = {
            cert = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/certs/localhost.crt",
            key = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/certs/localhost.key",
          },
          ["www.somewhere.com:8443"] = {
            cert = "/home/userx/certs/somewhere.crt",
            key = "/home/userx/certs/somewhere.key",
          },
        },
      },
    }
<


DISABLE CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION*kulala.authentication-authentication-disable-certificate-verification*

For development purposes, you may have a host with self-signed or expired
certificates. If you trust this host, you can disable verification of its
certificate.

In the http-client.private.env.json file, add `verifyHostCertificate": false`
to the SSLConfiguration object. For example:

>json
    {
      "dev": {
        "SSLConfiguration": {
          "verifyHostCertificate": false
        }
      }
    }
<

If you run a request with this environment, the certificate verification will
be disabled.

This is equivalent to setting `--insecure` flag in `additional_curl_options` in
the config file or with `# @curl-insecure` in the request.
