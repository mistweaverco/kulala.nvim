1. Dynamically setting environment variables based on response JSON*kulala.dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-response-json-dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-response-json*

You can set environment variables based on the response JSON of a HTTP request.

Create a file with the `.http` extension and write your HTTP requests in it.


WITH BUILT-IN PARSER*kulala.dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-response-json-dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-response-json-with-built-in-parser*

If the response is a _uncomplicated_ JSON object, you can set environment
variables using the |kulala.request-variables| feature.

WITH EXTERNAL COMMAND*kulala.dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-response-json-dynamically-setting-environment-variables-based-on-response-json-with-external-command*

If the response is a _complex_ JSON object, you can use the `@env-stdin-cmd`
directive to set environment variables using an external command (e.g., `jq`).

Response is passed to the command via standard input (stdin) and the result is
assigned to a variable, which can be used in subsequent requests.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a common example where the response JSON is complex.

In this example `jq` is used to extract the `ctx` string from a JWT token.

    # Any external command can be used to set the environment variables.
    # The command should output the environment variable as string.
