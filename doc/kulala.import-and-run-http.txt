1. Import and Run *.http files*kulala.import-and-run-http-import-and-run-*.http-files*

Kulala lets you import HTTP requests from other .http files. You can:

- Run all HTTP requests from specified files
- Run specific HTTP requests from imported files
- Run specific HTTP requests from current file


USAGE           *kulala.import-and-run-http-import-and-run-*.http-files-usage*


RUN ALL REQUESTS FROM ANOTHER .HTTP FILE

In your .http file, enter `run` followed by the name of another .http that you
want to include. If the file is in the same directory, enter its name.
Otherwise, specify a relative or absolute path to it.

For example:

>http
    run ./requests/get-requests.http
<


RUN SPECIFIC REQUESTS FROM ANOTHER .HTTP FILE

At the top of your .http file, enter `import` followed by the name or path of
another .http that contains necessary requests. Enter `run` and specify the
name of the request that you want to run prefixed with `#`. The name of the
request is specified next to delimiter `###`, otherwise the `URL` without the
http version is used.

get-requests.http

>http
    ### Request 1
    
    GET https://httpbin.org/advanced_1 HTTP/1.1
    
    ###
    
    POST https://httpbin.org/advanced_2 HTTP/1.1
<

>http
    import ./requests/get-requests.http
    
    run #Request 1
    run #POST https://httpbin.org/advanced_2
<


OVERRIDE VARIABLES FROM IMPORTED .HTTP FILES

If the imported .http file contains variables, you can specify or change their
values for specific executions. Enter `run` and specify the name of an .http
file or a request.

After the name of a request or a file, enter variables in the
`(@variable=value)` format. To specify multiple variables, separate them by
commas. For example:

>http
    import new-requests.http
    
    run #Request with one var (@host=example.com)
    
    run #Request with two vars (@host=example.com, @user=userName)
<

- The `import` command is bound to the whole document, while the `run` command is bound to a request section.
- Nested imports are supported. You can import .http files that contain `import` and `run` from other .http files.
- Variables from imported files (both request blocks and shared blocks) are merged into the importing document’s shared variables.


RUN SPECIFIC REQUESTS FROM THE CURRENT .HTTP FILE

In the example below, when you run `#Request_one`, it will run the
`Authenticate` request first, and then the `Request_one` request.

>http
    ### Authenticate
    POST https://httpbin.org/post HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
    
    < ./sample.ndjson
    
    
    
    ### Request_one
    
    run #Authenticate
    
    POST https://httpbin.org/post HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "results": [
        { "id": 1, "desc": "some_username" },
        { "id": 2, "desc": "another_username" }
      ]
    }
<


RUN SPECIFIC REQUESTS FROM THE CURRENT .HTTP FILE AND APPLY METADATA TO IT

You can have just a `run` command in a request block, without a URL line.

In this case, the metadata that you have in the block will be applied to the
request that you are running.

In the example below, when you run `#Email`, it will run the `#Main` request
and apply the JQ filter from the `#Email` block to the response of the `#Main`
request.

>http
    ### Main
    
    GET https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 HTTP/1.1
    X-Api-Key: reqres-free-v1
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    
    ### Email
    
    run #Main
    
    # @jq .data[] | {id, email}
    
    
    ### Name
    
    run #Main
    
    # @jq .data[] | {id, first_name}
<

- When you have a request and a `run` command in the same block, if you place the cursor on the line with
    the `run` command and execute it, Kulala will only run the requests specified in the `run` command.
