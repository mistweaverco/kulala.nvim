1. Import and Run *.http files*kulala.import-and-run-http-import-and-run-*.http-files*

Kulala lets you import HTTP requests from other .http files. You can:

- Run all HTTP requests from specified files
- Run specific HTTP requests from imported files


USAGE           *kulala.import-and-run-http-import-and-run-*.http-files-usage*


RUN ALL REQUESTS FROM ANOTHER .HTTP FILE ~

In your .http file, enter `run` followed by the name of another .http that you
want to include. If the file is in the same directory, enter its name.
Otherwise, specify a relative or absolute path to it. For example:

>http
    run ./requests/get-requests.http
<


RUN SPECIFIC REQUESTS FROM ANOTHER .HTTP FILE ~

At the top of your .http file, enter `import` followed by the name or path of
another .http that contains necessary requests. Enter `run` and specify the
name of the request that you want to run prefixed with `#`. The name of the
request is specified next to delimiter `###`, otherwise the `URL` without the
http version is used. To autocomplete available requests, use the `Ctrl-X
Ctrl-U` shortcut.

get-requests.http

>http
    ### Request 1
    
    GET https://httpbin.org/advanced_1 HTTP/1.1
    
    ###
    
    POST https://httpbin.org/advanced_2 HTTP/1.1
<

>http
    import ./requests/get-requests.http
    
    run #Request 1
    run #POST https://httpbin.org/advanced_2
<


OVERRIDE VARIABLES FROM IMPORTED .HTTP FILES ~

If the imported .http file contains variables, you can specify or change their
values for specific executions. Enter `run` and specify the name of an .http
file or a request.

After the name of a request or a file, enter variables in the
`(@variable=value)` format. To specify multiple variables, separate them by
commas. For example:

>http
    import new-requests.http
    
    run #Request with one var (@host=example.com)
    
    run #Request with two vars (@host=example.com, @user=userName)
