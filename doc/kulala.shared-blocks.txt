1. Shared Blocks                          *kulala.shared-blocks-shared-blocks*

Shared blocks can be used to share variables, metadata, scripts and requests
between multiple requests.

To declare a shared block, use the `### Shared` or `### Shared each` request
name for the `first` request in the document.

Shared variables and metadata will apply to all requests that follow the shared
block. Variables and metadata declared in a request will shadow shared
variables and metadata.

Scripts and requests declared in the shared block and called with `run` command
will be executed before the request you run.


### SHARED BLOCK         *kulala.shared-blocks-shared-blocks-###-shared-block*

- When executing `run request`, the shared scripts and requests will be executed before the request you run.
- When executing `run all requests`, the shared scripts and requests will be executed `once` before all requests.


### SHARED EACH BLOCK*kulala.shared-blocks-shared-blocks-###-shared-each-block*

- When executing `run request`, the shared scripts and requests will be executed before the request you run.
- When executing `run all requests`, the shared scripts and requests will be executed before `each` request.


VARIABLE SCOPE             *kulala.shared-blocks-shared-blocks-variable-scope*

By default variables are scoped to `document`, which means they are shared
across all requests in the document and later declarations will override
previous ones, including the ones in shared blocks.

You can change the scope to `variables_scope = "request"` in the options, which
will make variables scoped to the current request only and shared variables
will not be overridden by request variables.

SHARED HEADERS AND POST_REQUEST SCRIPTS*kulala.shared-blocks-shared-blocks-shared-headers-and-post_request-scripts*

If you want to also share headers or post request scripts, but not the actual
request, use `NOP` as a url placeholder.
