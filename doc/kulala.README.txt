CONFIGURATION

>lua
    require("lazy").setup({

        "mistweaverco/kulala.nvim",
        keys = {
          { "<leader>Rs", desc = "Send request" },
          { "<leader>Ra", desc = "Send all requests" },
          { "<leader>Rb", desc = "Open scratchpad" },

HONORABLE MENTIONS              *kulala.README-kulala.nvim-honorable-mentions*


REST.NVIM

For getting this project started.

This project was heavily inspired by the idea of having a REST client in
Neovim.

The actual state of rest.nvim https://github.com/rest-nvim/rest.nvim as
archived kicked off the development of kulala.nvim.


  [!NOTE] The project has been un-archived
  https://github.com/rest-nvim/rest.nvim/issues/398#issue-2442747909 again, so
  check it out if you’re looking for an alternative.

CURL.NVIM

If you want a simple scratchpad for making HTTP requests, check out curl.nvim
https://github.com/oysandvik94/curl.nvim

It’s very different to this project, but it’s a great tool for making HTTP
requests from within Neovim and maybe just your cup of tea.


HTTPBIN.ORG

For providing a great service for testing HTTP requests and making it in all
the kulala examples.

Thanks for making it easy to test and develop this plugin.
