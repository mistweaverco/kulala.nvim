BASIC USAGE SUMMARY (WITH DEFAULT KEYMAPS)*kulala.nvim.basic-usage-basic-usage-basic-usage-summary-(with-default-keymaps)*


EXECUTE REQUEST ~

There are several ways to execute a request:

- Position the cursor on the line of the request or in the block of the request delimited by `###` and then press `<CR>` or `<leader>Rs` to run the request.
- Select several requests in visual mode and press `<CR>` or `<leader>Ra` to run the requests.
- Press `<leader>Ra` to run all requests in the buffer.
- You can use `#` or `//` to comment out a request or its data, and it wil not be processed.


EXECUTING REQUESTS IN NON .HTTP FILES ~

- You can execute requests in any file type. However, since the `###` delimiters are only recognized in `.http` files, you will need to position the cursor exactly on the line with the request or visually select the required requests and their accompanying data.
- Common comment syntax is recognized, so you can run requests that are commented out in your code, for example:

>lua
    vim.system("curl -X GET http://localhost:3000")
    
    -- POST http://localhost:3000
    -- Content-Type: application/json
    -- {"name": "John Doe"}
<


KULALA UI ~

- Kulala UI is opened automatically when you run a request or you can open it manually with `<leader>Ro` at any time.
- You can switch between different views with `(H) Headers`, `B (Body)`, `(A) All`, `(V) Verbose`, `(S) Stats`, `(O) Script output`, `(R) Report`
- To scroll through the history of responses use `[` and `]`.
- To clear responses history press `X`.
- To jump to the request in the request buffer press `<CR>`.
- To open help window press `?`.
- To open the Kulala scratch buffer use `<leader>Rb`.
- To choose variables environment use `<leader>Re` and select the environment you want to use.
- To manage Auth configurations use `<leader>Ru`.
