IMPORTING

The import is provided by the formatter module which should be enabled in the
options:

>lua
    opts = { lsp = { formatter = true } }
<

Import can be run either through `Convert to HTTP` code action, which is
available in `json`, `yaml`, and `bruno` files, or directly with
`require("kulala").import(from)` command, where
`from=nil|"postman"|"openapi"|"bruno"`, while inside the buffer with the file
to import.

The importer will try to detect the format automatically, but if it fails, you
can specify it explicitly by passing the format as an argument.


EXPORTING

Kulala supports exporting to Postman collections format only.

Export can be run either through `Export file` or `Export folder` code action,
which is available in `http` and `rest` files, or directly with
`require("kulala").export(path)` command, where `path=file|folder|nil`, while
inside the buffer with the HTTP collection to export.

Currently, Kulala supports export of Authentication data for Basic and Bearer
authentication methods only. If you need to export other authentication
methods, please open an issue on the Kulala GitHub repository.
