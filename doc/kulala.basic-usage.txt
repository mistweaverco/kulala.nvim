BASIC USAGE SUMMARY (WITH DEFAULT KEYMAPS)*kulala.basic-usage-basic-usage-basic-usage-summary-(with-default-keymaps)*


EXECUTE REQUEST

There are several ways to execute a request:

- Position the cursor on the line of the request or in the block of the request delimited by `###` and then press `<CR>` or `<leader>Rs` to run the request.
- Select several requests in visual mode and press `<CR>` or `<leader>Ra` to run the requests.
- Press `<leader>Ra` to run all requests in the buffer.
- Press `<C-c>` to cancel request execution.
- To search for a request in the buffer, press `<leader>Rf`.
- You can use `#` or `//` to comment out a request or its data, and it will not be processed.


EXECUTING REQUESTS IN NON .HTTP FILES

- You can execute requests from any file type. If you wrap your requests in a code block with `.. ````, it will behave just like in a`.http` file.

>http
    - Common comment syntax is recognized, so you can put requests in the comments of your code files.
    
    If you cannot wrap requests in a code block, you will need to position the cursor exactly on the line with the request or visually select the required 
    requests and their accompanying data.
    
    ```js
    // You javascript code here
    console.log('Hello world!');
    
    /* My test request
    
    ```http
    POST http://localhost:3000
    Content-Type: application/json
    {"name": "John Doe"}
<


KULALA UI

- Kulala UI is opened automatically when you run a request or you can open it manually with `<leader>Ro` at any time.
- You can switch between different views with `(H) Headers`, `B (Body)`, `(A) All`, `(V) Verbose`, `(S) Stats`, `(O) Script output`, `(R) Report`
- To scroll through the history of responses use `[` and `]`.
- To clear responses history press `X`.
- To jump to the request in the request buffer press `<CR>`.
- To open help window press `?`.
- To open the Kulala scratch buffer use `<leader>Rb`.
- To choose variables environment use `<leader>Re` and select the environment you want to use.
- To manage Authentication configurations use `<leader>Ru`.


KULALA LSP AND FORMATTER

Kulala includes a built-in in-process LSP server that provides the following
features:

- Autocompletion: HTTP syntax, metadata, commands, variables, requests, GraphQL
    schema and Kulala API.
- Symbols information: symbols search and symbols outline - `<leader>cs`,
    `<leader>cS`.
- Hover information for requests: equivalent to Kulala’s inspect command - `K`.
- Code actions: a list of all available Kulala commands - `gra/<leader>ca`.
- Formatting: format buffer/range - `gq/<leader>cf/<leader>lf`.
- Folding
- In `json/yaml/bruno` files, code actions will be available to convert
    collections into HTTP format.

Kulala LSP does not set any keymaps, but relies on your Neovim’s default LSP
keymaps. Some distributions set these keymaps only for LSPs that have been
setup through `nvim-lspconfig` or the distributions’s own LSP config. In this
case, you may need to enable them yourself.

Please refer to |kulala.keymaps.txt| for more information.

Some plugins, like `lsp-saga` or `nvim-lighbulb` show :bulb: signs when there
are code actions available.

Since Kulala provides code actions for every line, you may want to disable them
in your config. For example:

>lua
    require('lspsaga').setup({
      lightbulb = { ignore = { clients = { 'kulala' } } }
    })
    
    require("nvim-lightbulb").setup({
     ignore = { clients = { "kulala" } }
    })

SYNTAX SUMMARY

- `#` and `//` is used to comment out a request or its data.
- `###` is used to delimit requests and their data.
- `### Request name` is used to name a request, for UI, `import` / `run` commands and to reference the request data in other requests.


METADATA

- `# @meta-name meta-value` is used to add arbitrary metadata to a request or file.
- `# @prompt variable-name prompt-string` is used to prompt the user for input and store it in a variable.
- `# @secret variable-name prompt-string` same as `@prompt`, but the input is hidden (useful for passwords).


DIRECTIVES

- `# @accept chunked` allows you to accept Transfer-Encoding: chunked responses and streamed responses.
- `# @curl-...` allows you to set flags for curl requests.
- `# @grpc-...` allows you to set flags for gRPC requests.
- `# @stdin-cmd-pre` allows you to execute an external command before the request is sent.
- `# @stdin-cmd` allows you to execute an external command
- `# @jq` allows you to filter the response body using jq.
- `# @delay` allows you to set a delay (in milliseconds) before sending the request.


VARIABLES

- `@variable-name=variable-value` is used to define variables that can be used in request URL, headers and body.
- `{{variable}}` allows you to use variables defined in `metadata`, `system environment` variables, `http-client.env.json` file or `.env` file.
- `{{$dynamic-variable}}` allows you to use predefined dynamic, aka `magic` variables.
- `# @env-stdin-cmd-pre` allows you to set environment variables using an external command, before the request is sent.
- `# @env-stdin-cmd` allows you to set environment variables using an external command.
- `# @env-json-key` allows you to set environment variables using a JSON path on the response body.
- `# @env-header-key` allows you to set environment variables from the response headers.


REQUESTS IMPORT

- `import /path/to/file` allows you to import requests from another file.
- `run #request-name` allows you to run a named request.
- `run /path/to/file` allows you to run all requests in another file.


FILE INPUT/OUTPUT

- `< /path/to/file` allows you to include the contents of a file in the request.
- `>> /path/to/file` allows you to save the response to a file. Use `>>!` to overwrite the file if it exists.


SCRIPTS

- `< {% %}` and `< {% -- lua }` allow you to run an inline `pre-request` `js|lua` scripts.
- `< /path/to/script.js|lua` allows you to run a `pre-request` `js|lua` script in a file.
- `> {% %}` and `> {% --lua %}` allows you to run an inline `post-request` `js|lua` script.
- `> /path/to/script.js|lua` allows you to run a `post-request` `js|lua` script in a file.

For details please consult the corresponding sections in the documentation.
